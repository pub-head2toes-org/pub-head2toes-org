Installation & Setup**\nBefore launching **Eve**, you’ll need to install **Ollama** on your local machine and pull a desired AI model. This ensures Eve can communicate with your AI models seamlessly. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored for **Mac, Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi**.\n\n---\n\n## **3.1 Prerequisites**\n### **1. Install Ollama**\nOllama is a lightweight AI deployment platform that hosts models locally. Follow these steps to install it:\n\n#### **For macOS**\n1. **Download Ollama**:\n   - Visit the [Ollama Download Page](https://ollama.com/download) and download the `.dmg` file for macOS.\n   - Open the `.dmg` file and drag **Ollama** to your **Applications** folder.\n\n2. **Install via Homebrew (Alternative)**:\n   ```bash\n   brew install ollama/tap/ollama\n   ```\n\n#### **For Windows**\n1. **Download Ollama**:\n   - Visit the [Ollama Download Page](https://ollama.com/download) and download the `.exe` installer.\n   - Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.\n\n#### **For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**\n1. **Add Ollama’s repository**:\n   ```bash\n   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n   ```\n   (For other Linux distributions, check the [Ollama Docs](https://ollama.com/download).)\n\n#### **For Raspberry Pi (ARM-based)**\n1. **Install via `.deb` package** (recommended for Pi OS):\n   ```bash\n   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\n   ```\n   (Ensure your Pi is running **64-bit OS** for best performance.)\n\n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   ```bash\n   ollama --version\n   ```\n   (You should see the installed version, e.g., `Ollama version v0.1.1`.)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Pull an AI Model**\nOllama hosts a variety of open-source models. To use Eve, you’ll need to download one. Here’s how:\n\n#### **List Available Models**\n```bash\nollama list\n```\n(Check the [Ollama Models Page](https://ollama.com/models) for the latest options.)\n\n#### **Pull a Model (Example: `gemma3`)**\n```bash\nollama pull gemma3\n```\n(Replace `gemma3` with your preferred model, e.g., `llama2`, `mistral`, or `phi`.)\n\n#### **Verify the Model**\n```bash\nollama list\n```\n(You should see your model listed under `REPOSITORIES`.)\n\n---\n\n## **3.2 Launching Eve**\nOnce Ollama is installed and a model is pulled, you can launch **Eve** via your browser.\n\n### **Option 1: Install Eve as a PWA (Progressive Web App)**\n1. **Open Eve in Your Browser**:\n   - Visit the Eve PWA URL (e.g., `https://your-eve-app.com` or a local dev server if self-hosted).\n   - Click **\"Install\"** (Chrome/Firefox/Edge) to add Eve to your home screen.\n\n2. **First-Time Setup**:\n   - Eve will auto-detect Ollama running on `localhost:11434`.\n   - If prompted, confirm the connection.\n\n### **Option 2: Run Eve via Terminal (CLI Mode)**\nIf you prefer a command-line interface:\n```bash\nollama run gemma3 --eve\n```\n*(Note: This is a hypothetical CLI flag—adjust based on Eve’s actual implementation.)*\n\n---\n\n## **3.3 Troubleshooting**\n### **Issue: Ollama Not Running**\n- **Check the service**:\n  ```bash\n  ollama serve\n  ```\n  (Run this in a separate terminal tab.)\n\n- **Firewall/Network Issues**:\n  Ensure your machine allows connections on `localhost:11434`.\n\n### **Issue: Model Not Found**\n- Verify the model name:\n  ```bash\n  ollama list\n  ```\n- Pull the correct model (e.g., `ollama pull llama2`).\n\n### **Issue: Eve Can’t Connect to Ollama**\n- Confirm Ollama is running:\n  ```bash\n  curl http://localhost:11434\n  ```\n  (Should return a JSON response.)\n\n- Check Eve’s API endpoint settings (if self-hosted).\n\n---\n\n## **Next Steps**\nNow that Ollama is set up and Eve is installed, you’re ready to explore **Core Features** (Chapter 4), including:\n- AI-powered chat interfaces\n- Model customization\n- Integration with local files\n\nWould you like me to draft **Chapter 4: Core Features** next?","time":87.102}],"selections":{"model":0,"endpoint":2}}}
